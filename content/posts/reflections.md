Wow, it's hard to believe that my time at [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/) has come to an end (for now). Recurse Center is a self-directed educational retreat for programmers, normally based in NYC, but currently being run remotely. 

While at times it felt I wasn't as productive as I'd like to be, when I think back to where I was a progammer at the beginning of batch, I've made tremendous progress! I started to learn programming at the beginning of the pandemic because I wanted to redo my portfolio site - look at me now! 

I am so happy and thankful to have the opportunity to be part of a community of wonderful, creative and welcoming programmers. Never graduate!
