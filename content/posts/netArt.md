As I become more comfortable with web development in a more function/design context, I've been experimenting more and more with doing more net art type projects. 

Most recently, I decided to venture into web scraping with [Cheerio](https://cheerio.js.org/) (a JavaScript alternative to Python's [Beautiful Soup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/)). There are plenty of artists/creative projects that use web scraping as a medium, including [Virtual Watchers](http://www.virtualwatchers.de/VW.html),
