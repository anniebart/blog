Lately, I've heard (or more aptly, read), a lot of chatter about the speed in which technology has shaped our behavior. Critics lament our supposedly ever shrinking attention span, Amazon has created the expection of 2 day delivery for...well, just about everything, while we bemoan waiting for our ubers and lyfts if it takes longer than 5 minutes. It seems to me that a lot of which underlies this anxiety is the throttling of the speed in which we live our lives. 

Which is fair. 

If you think about other technologies and how they've shaped the culture in which they were invented, the shifts seemed more gradual, more tempered. The first printing press was invented in the 15th century (over 500 years ago!!), yet books created with one weren't widely available for centuries. The first (practical) steam locomotive engine was invented in 1804, but still, apparently America's first locomotive engine [still lost a race to a horse](https://www.history.com/news/8-things-you-may-not-know-about-trains#:~:text=When%20Englishman%20Richard%20Trevithick%20launched,averaged%20less%20than%2010%20mph.).
