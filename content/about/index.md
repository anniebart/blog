Hello!

I'm Annie. I'm an artist, designer, programmer and environmentalist. I like to create interactive web applications and data visualizations combining my all interests and am particularly intrigued by speculative design. I'm a alum of [Middlebury College](http://www.middlebury.edu/) and [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/). 

You can find more of my work [here](https://www.anniebartholomew.com/)
